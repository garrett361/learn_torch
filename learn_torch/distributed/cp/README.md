# Ring Attention

This dir contains a naive, torch-native, compile-friendly ring attention implementation for prefill.

The implementation is in `torch_cp_inference.py`. `test.py` has `pytest` tests and `test_script.py`
is a standalone test script. The `torch.compile` artifacts were generated by running `test_script.py`
using `torch==2.5.1`.
